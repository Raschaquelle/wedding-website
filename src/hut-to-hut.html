			<div class = "text">
				Instead of taking a traditional honeymoon (thanks Covid-19 😜), we’d like to celebrate our marriage 
				by going on a hut-to-hut backpacking trip with some of our closest friends. Backpacking and staying 
				at backcountry huts is something we really enjoy and we’d like to share that joy with you all. We 
				also feel this is a nice way to spend more time with people given everyone is traveling relatively 
				far for the wedding and we want to make that travel well worth it.
			</div>
			<div class="title-text">Trip Details</div>
			<div class = "text">
				We will be spending 5 days (4 nights) on the trail and each night we will stay in a different hut run by 
				<a target="_self" href = https://sanjuanhuts.com><u class = "link">San Juan Huts</u></a>. The trip will cover 
				approximately 24 miles over the course of 5 days through the 
				<a target="_self" href = https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gmug/recarea/?recid=80858><u class = "link">Mount Sneffels Wilderness</u></a>,
				almost entirely along the <a target="_self" href = https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7005522/dallas-trail><u class = "link">Dallas Trail</u></a>.
				This is considered the “Sneffels Traverse” on the San Juan Huts’ site if you want to look for more information.

			<div class="title-text">Huts</div>
			<div class = "text">
				Each hut features 8 bunked beds, a wood stove, a two burner propane stove, sink, and cooking/eating utensils. Specific amenities 
				for the huts can be found <a target="_self" href = https://sanjuanhuts.com/documents><u class = "link">here</u></a>. Each hut can accommodate 8 people and we 
				will be booking out the entire hut such that we are the only party staying at the hut. We’ve stayed at multiple different huts 
				before and have really enjoyed all of them; they are super nice and usually have great views! However, keep in mind that these are 
				backcountry huts so while they are really nice they don’t have running water, only have a pit toilet, and we will be making all of 
				our own food.
			</div>
			<div class = "text">
				We will be carrying all of our own food and making all of our food at the huts. We will be putting together a food list ahead of time 
				and then work together as a group to divy up the food responsibilities. Part of the fun on these trips is seeing what different people 
				bring and making food together in a small space with limited tools.

			<div class="title-text">Costs</div>
			<div class = "text">
				The cost per person for the entire trip will be $140. This covers staying at the huts all 4 nights and the shuttle ride at the beginning 
				of the trip. This cost does not cover food, which we will be splitting and figuring out closer to the trip. All of the huts have already 
				been booked so payments will be made to Ben at a later date. If you’d like to come on the trip but the cost is an issue, please
