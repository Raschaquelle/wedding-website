			<div class="title-text">Overview</div>
			<div class = "text">
				Instead of taking a traditional honeymoon (thanks Covid-19 ðŸ˜œ), weâ€™d like to celebrate our marriage 
				by going on a hut-to-hut backpacking trip with some of our closest friends. Backpacking and staying 
				at backcountry huts is something we really enjoy and weâ€™d like to share that joy with you all. We 
				also feel this is a nice way to spend more time with people given everyone is traveling relatively 
				far for the wedding and we want to make that travel well worth it.
			</div>
			<div class="title-text">Trip Details</div>
			<div class = "text">
				We will be spending 4 days in total split between two different backcountry huts run by 
				<a target="_self" href = https://sanjuanhuts.com><u class = "link">San Juan Huts</u></a>. The trip will cover 
				approximately 23 miles over the course of 5 days through the 
				<a target="_self" href = https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gmug/recarea/?recid=80858><u class = "link">Mount Sneffels Wilderness</u></a>,
				almost entirely along the <a target="_self" href = https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7005522/dallas-trail><u class = "link">Dallas Trail</u></a>.

			<div class="title-text">Huts</div>
			<div class = "text">
				Each hut features 8 bunked beds, a wood stove, a two burner propane stove, sink, and cooking/eating utensils. Specific amenities 
				for the huts can be found <a target="_self" href = https://sanjuanhuts.com/documents><u class = "link">here</u></a>. Each hut can accommodate 8 people and we 
				will be booking out the entire hut such that we are the only party staying at the hut. Weâ€™ve stayed at multiple different huts 
				before and have really enjoyed all of them; they are super nice and usually have great views! However, keep in mind that these are 
				backcountry huts so while they are really nice they donâ€™t have running water, only have a pit toilet, and we will be making all of 
				our own food.
			</div>
			<div class = "text">
				Each hut costs $30/person/night so it will cost $120/person for the entire trip. We will be booking the huts in advance so payments will 
				be made to Ben closer to the wedding date. If youâ€™re interested in the trip, but the cost is an issue please let us know as weâ€™d hate for 
				someone to miss out because of money.
			</div>
			<div class = "text">
				We will be carrying all of our own food and making all of our food at the huts. We will be putting together a food list ahead of time and 
				then work together as a group to divy up the food responsibilities. Part of the fun on these trips is seeing what different people bring and 
				making food together in a small space with limited tools.
