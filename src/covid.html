				<ul>
					<li><b>We feel responsible for making sure the risks are as low as possible and that everyone feels safe.</b></li>
					<ul>
						<li> will be monitoring the situation as it evolves and will make adjustments as necessary, but are planning 
							conservatively and do not expect significant improvements prior to the wedding</li>
					</ul>
					<li>People will be attending from various locations in Colorado, the DC metro area, rural Wyoming, and western NY</li>
						<ul>
							<li>We understand that this presents a reasonable exposure risk and thus we are expecting all participants 
								to follow the pre-travel and travel requirements in the following section.</li>
						</ul>			
					<li>The pre-travel and travel requirements are to allow us to stay in shared lodging together and have as close to a “normal” experience as possible</li>
					<ul>
						<li>We are not requiring masks or social distancing during the wedding and wedding-related festivities</li>
					</ul>
					<li>We expect and trust all attendees to be respectful of our requirements (as well as any local, state, or national COVID related requirements)</li>
					<li><b>If you have questions or concerns about these requirements, please ask</b></li>
