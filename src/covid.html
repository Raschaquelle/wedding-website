				Our goal is to have an intimate wedding and a fun post wedding backpacking trip 
				that is as close to normal as possible. In order to make that happen we are taking 
				COVID-19 very seriously and instituting a set of precautions to allow us to have a 
				small gathering of people in person without masks and social distancing. It is only 
				by following these precautions and continuing to monitor the evolving COVID-19 
				situation that we can make this wedding as safe as possible. All that said, there is 
				no such thing as “zero risk” and we feel that it is important to make you aware of the 
				fact that there will be a certain amount of risk associated with attending the wedding.

				The wedding itself will be held outdoors along the Colorado Trail. The reception will be held indoors

				All guests will be required to stay together at the lodging location if they are planning 
				on staying overnight. Here is a detailed breakdown of where guests are coming from:

				<b>May 2021 Update:</b> The situation in Colorado and throughout the U.S. has greatly improved thanks to the 
				wide distribution of vaccines. That said, cases are still high in some areas so we want to continue to be cautious

			<div class="title-text">COVID-19 Precaution Requirements</div>
			<div class = "text">
				Generally the requirements are to self-isolate prior to traveling and to wear masks and practice social

				<b>Travel Requirements:</b>
				<br>
				<ol>
					<li>Quarantine/Self-Isolate for 14 days prior to attending the wedding (this time can include travel time)</li>
					<ol type = "a">
						<li>This means to <b>stay home</b> except for essential activities which are listed below.</li>
						<ul>

								<u>Note</u>: Going to the gym and going out to eat are NOT considered essential activities.</li>
							<li>Going to work is totally fine if your work requires you to be in person and has a strict 
								COVID-19 policy including mask wearing, frequent sanitation, capacity limitations, etc.</li>

						<li>The CDC is currently still recommending a <a target="_self" href = https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html><u class = "link">14 day quarantine</u></a> 
							if you have potentially been exposed (via close contact) to COVID-19. A shorter quarantine 
							of 7 to 10 days is acceptable under certain circumstances such as a negative test result</li>
							<ul>
								<a class="red"><li><b>May 2021 Update:</b> If you have been fully vaccinated the CDC does not recommend a quarantine if you have potentially 
									been exposed to Covid-19. That said, we still ask that you self-isolate for 14 days prior to the wedding.
								</li></a>
							</ul>
					</ol>
					<li>Wear masks and practice social distancing during your travels and when in any public place (i.e. rest stops, gas stations)
						<a class="red"><b>May 2021 Update:</b>This is especially important as many places are now lifting mask orders and other COVID-19 related public health orders.</a>
					</li>
					<li>Travel by private transportation (i.e. your personal vehicle).</li>
					<ol type = "a">
						<li>Please follow the <a target="_self" href = https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html><u class = "link">CDC’s travel guidelines</u></a> 
							(also <a target="_self" href = https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-risk.html><u class = "link">here</u></a>)

					<ol type = "a">
						<li>Campground/Dispersed Camping</li>
						<li>AirBnB/Hotel/Motel if it has a mask policy, separate facilities from other guests (i.e. not a shared

			</div>
			<div class = "text">
				<b>Wedding Requirements:</b>
				<br>
				<ol>
					<li>Stay at the provided lodging with all other guests (this self-isolates all wedding guests)</li>
					<li>Wear masks when out in <a class="red">indoor</a> public places <a class="red">(i.e. visiting stores, using a public restroom, etc.)</a></li>

				<b>May 2021 Update:</b> The <a target="_self" href = https://covid19.colorado.gov/mask-guidance><u class = "link">statewide mask mandate in Colorado</u></a> 
				is still currently in effect but only applies to indoor public spaces and in cases where less than 80% of the people in the indoor 
				space are not vaccinated. For this reason, we are lifting the previous requirement of needing to wear masks while hiking to the 
				wedding ceremony or interacting with the photographer. We have confirmed that the photographer is fully vaccinated.
			</div>
			<div class="title-text">Why the Precautions?</div>
			<div class = "text">
				We want to have guests be able to stay together and be able to have an indoor reception after the wedding. 
				During the course of the wedding festivities we want people to be able to be in close physical contact 
				(i.e. hugging, handshakes) and not have to wear masks when indoors with other guests. The best way to do this 
				is to reduce the risk that guests have had contact with someone with COVID-19 prior to attending the wedding.
			</div>
			<div class = "text red">
				<b>May 2021 Update:</b> With the wide distribution of vaccines, the safest and most effective way to ensure that the 
				wedding is as low risk as possible is to get vaccinated. If you have access to the vaccine and feel comfortable doing 
				so, we highly encourage you to get the vaccine. 
			</div>
			<div class="title-text">What About Flying?</div>
			<div class = "text">
				While the risk of contracting COVID-19 <a target="_self" href = https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2771435><u class = "link">during a flight is very low</u></a> 
				(also <a target="_self" href = https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/evaluating-covid-risk-on-planes-trains-and-automobiles2/><u class = "link">here</u></a>), 
				the CDC still advises against air travel due to the need to be in close contact with people in airports where proper social 
				distancing and air circulation is not always possible. So while being in the actual plane is likely pretty safe, getting from 
				your home to that plane is quite risky and we believe that risk is not worth it.
			</div>
			<div class = "text red">
				<b>May 2021 Update:</b> We are still not allowing guests to fly to the wedding.
			</div>
			<div class="title-text">What About Vaccines?</div>
			<div class = "text red">
				<b>May 2021 Update:</b> Vaccines are now widely available and we highly encourage you to get the vaccine if you have 
				access to it and are comfortable doing so. We have confirmed that most of the people attending the wedding (including 
				the photographer) will be fully vaccinated by the time of the wedding. This greatly reduces the risk associated with 
				the wedding which is great news! Additionally, this means for those of you who are not vaccinated, you will be well 
				protected by the other attendees.
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class = "text">
				Even if you are vaccinated, the CDC still recommends 
				<a target="_self" href = https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html><u class = "link">maintaining similar precautions such as mask wearing and social distancing</u></a>. 
				Please be respectful of other guests though and continue to follow the above listed precautions.
