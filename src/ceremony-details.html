				<b>Notes:</b> We expect to wear face masks at the trailhead and along the trail as we will likely encounter

				expect to stand for ~30min (likely less). We will have a professional photographer hiking with us and during 
				the ceremony but please feel free to take as many photos/videos as you want.

			<div class = "text">
				<a target="_self" href = https://goo.gl/maps/tsdkiDPmuorQEd3e8><u class = "link">Little Molas Lake</u></a> is located at a small National Forest 
				Campground about a 10min drive south of Silverton, CO. The trailhead is accessible via a short (~1mi) dirt road 
				(<a target="_self" href = https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd492994.pdf><u class = "link">FR 584</u></a>) off of US Highway 550 
				that is well graded and 2WD accessible.

			<div class = "text">
				The ceremony itself will take place in the <a target="_self" href = https://goo.gl/maps/JRDRESAYgHYMNymm7><u class = "link">alpine tundra just south of West Turkshead Peak</u></a>.
				To access this location, we will be hiking <a target="_self" href = https://caltopo.com/m/P0BH><u class = "link">~2mi up the Colorado Trail (Segment 25)</u></a>.
				This trail is very mild and well graded but does not have any shade. The trail will be gaining ~700ft in elevation.

				<b>Some advice for the hike:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Drink plenty of water</li>
					<li>Wear sunglasses and plenty of sunscreen</li>
					<li>There’s a possibility there will be some snow on the trail so be prepared for that</li>
					<li>The weather should be fairly mild (low to mid 60s) but it may windy</li>
					<li>Bring warm hat, gloves, and a jacket (hopefully these won’t be needed)</li>
					<li>Bring/wear a hat that can provide shade</li>
					<li>Trail runners or sneakers will likely be sufficient but feel free to wear boots if you prefer more support</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<i><b>Note:</b> If for some reason snow or inclimate weather prevent the ceremony from being held as intended the backup plan 
				will be to hold the ceremony directly at Little Molas Lake. If that is also not possible then the ceremony will be held at the 
				<a target="_self" href = lodging.html><u class = "link">lodging</u></a> location.</i>
